# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, training a RandomForestClassifier, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers. Each sample has four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
